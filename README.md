## About

**RevisR** is a free GCSE Revision Helper for Android by students, for students. Contributions to this product are happily accepted.

## Downloads

Either use the releases or build your own by downloading the source code and building in Visual Studio 2017. Note that you need to have first run the Visual Studio Installer and installed the Xamarin Android Package.

Every change on the `master` branch results in a build under Releases, so please make changes in the `development` branch wherever possible.

## Contribution

### PDN Files

This project uses the free image editor [Paint.NET (PDN)](https://www.getpaint.net/) for its images. Please **DO NOT UPLOAD PHOTOSHOP FILES!** We use PDN so everyone can edit and contribute. In addition, when uploading any edited images, please provide `.pdn` files for them so that others can improve on those edits. Most uploads of images without their `.pdn` counterparts will be ignored/deleted.

Paint.NET includes almost every feature that Photoshop has, and those that are not available most likely have a plugin counterpart created by the community.

All `.pdn` files' layers should be clearly labelled. For example `/img/discord/get_github_notifications.pdn` has its layers named accurately. For example the drop shadow layer has all of its parameters written in the name: `drop shadow (x: 0, y: 0, widening: 5, blur: 8, opacity: 255, color: #000)`

### SVG Editing

If you wish to use Adobe Illustrator or Inkscape for SVG Editing that is okay as long as the SVG files are understandable. The Lead Developer's ([davwheat](https://www.github.com/davwheat)) SVG editing is mainly done by hand.
